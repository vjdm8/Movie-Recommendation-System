This Repository has code that tests Collaborative Filtering with SVD to Scale, utilizing Spark's MlLib. 

The code in ml10mRecSys.ipynb has comments describing the code. The other 2 ipynb files are similar in nature. 

A report of the Analysis carried out by my team and I, has also been attached. I have mainly contributed to the Spark part of the report.

Thank you.
